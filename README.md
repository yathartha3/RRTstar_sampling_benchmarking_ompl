# Sequential Decision Making Project
Quadrotor path planning using various sampling strategies on top of Informed RRT*. The waypoints generated by RRT* are then converted into minimum jerk trajectory which can be safely executed by quadrotor. We compared different sampling techniques available in OMPL.

Simulator used is RotorS simulator and a custom world in gazebo is used to test planning.
Presentation slides is available as pdf in this repo.
